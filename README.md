VoluBind is a client-side Quilt mod, allowing you
to toggle your volume between two values with the press of a button!
It allows you to create these keybindings for every single
volume option in Minecraft. Whether you want to temporarily toggle
off those annoying villager noises, or your incredibly loud
enderman farm, this mod is for you!


## Dependencies
This mod requires [Quilted Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl), [Quilt Kotlin Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qkl), and [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).

Quilt Kotlin Libraries is still very much
in its beta phase, so there may be some hiccups.
Please open [an issue here](https://github.com/Lilydev-by-Jade/VoluBind/issues)
first if you encounter any issues with VoluBind.
If it seems to be an issue with QKL instead
of my mod, I will open an issue on their GitHub page.
